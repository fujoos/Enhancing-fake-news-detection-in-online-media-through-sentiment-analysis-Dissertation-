# Enhancing-fake-news-detection-in-online-media-through-sentiment-analysis-Dissertation-

The proliferation of fake news in the evolving landscape of online media has been one of the most critical challenges to public trust and democratic discourse. This project aims to enhance fake news detection by integrating sentiment analysis with cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By analysing the emotional tone and subjective information within news content, coupled with linguistic and factual verification, the proposed system seeks to identify misleading information with greater accuracy. 
The research leverages sophisticated advanced algorithms and deep learning models, including BERT, T5, and RoBERTa, known for their deep contextual understanding capabilities, to dissect and interpret the complexities of language used in fake news. The dataset comprises a large number of comprising authentic and fabricated news used for the training, as well as the validation, of the detection model. e expected outcome is a robust tool that not only enhances the detection of fake news but also contributes to the body of knowledge in computational linguistics and information integrity. The project's success could significantly impact the digital information ecosystem, offering a scalable and efficient solution to combat the spread of misinformation, thereby fostering a more informed and discerning online community.
